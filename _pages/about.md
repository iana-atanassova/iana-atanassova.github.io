Iana Atanassova, Ph.D., is a Full Professor of Natural Language Processing at Université Marie et Louis Pasteur, Besançon, and Director of the Centre de Recherches Interdisciplinaires et Transculturelles (CRIT). As a junior member of the Institut Universitaire de France (IUF), she leads interdisciplinary research at the forefront of computational linguistics and scientific discourse analysis.

Her expertise lies in advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques applied to full-text scientific papers, including semantic annotation, ontology population, and information extraction. Dr. Atanassova’s work focuses on modeling scientific uncertainty, exploring the rhetorical structure of research articles, as well as developing innovative NLP applications for bibliometrics, competitive intelligence, and personal data processing.

With a strong track record of leadership in national and European projects, she supervises multiple doctoral and postdoctoral researchers and actively contributes to the scientific community through editorial boards, conference organization, and evaluation panels. Her research tackles the challenges of evaluating knowledge-based methods against machine learning and generative AI approaches in natural language processing, positioning her as a leading expert in the analysis and representation of knowledge in digital scientific publications.
