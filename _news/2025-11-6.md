Yesterday, I presented my work on the linguistic diversity in bibliographic references at the ISTEX 2025 national training in Nancy, dedicated to the uses and the promotion of the ISTEX platform: <a href="https://istex25-renatis.sciencesconf.org/" target="_blank">https://istex25-renatis.sciencesconf.org/</a>

I shared my experience in using ISTEX data to analyze the bibliographies. Our results demonstrate   the predominance of English as a lingua franca (if any further proof were needed...). Yet they also reveal the intrinsic richness of scientific communication: authors draw on knowledge from articles published in more than fifty other languages. Science is, above all, a multilingual and multicultural dialogue, and it is precisely this dialogue that ISTEX data enable us to explore and promote.
